<h3>Note on Icon Files</h3>

The traffic sign icon images in this folder are used to generate life-like traffic signs.
They are taken from

<a href="url">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_of_Germany</a>

and are in the public domain. 
The file format has been changed to Portable Network Graphics (.png).

<br/>

The file names indicate the traffic sign class according to the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark, e.g. "Speed Limit 50" 
refers to traffic sign class id 2, and thus should not be changed.
